# Data_Analysis_on_Netflix

In this project, I looked at a big list of Netflix movies and shows to find fun patterns. I wanted to know things like which type of movie shows up the most, which ones people like the most, and what year had the most movies made.

To do this, I used Python and pandas to clean up the messy parts of the data. I fixed missing stuff, changed dates so they were easier to read, and grouped vote scores to make them simpler. I also cleaned up the genre names so they all looked the same.

After that, I made charts and counted things to see what was happening. I found out that drama is the most common and most liked genre. And the year with the most movies was 2020.

This project helped me learn how to work with real data, clean it up, and explain what I found in a clear way. Iâ€™m using these skills to get better at data science and prepare for future jobs.
